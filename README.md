## A python chess client

A simple client to get started with coding a chess-ai in python. This client
talks to the chess server running on waltersmuts.com, playing against the Greedy
algorithm, by default. There is also a `Random` opponent for if you're struggling.

Take a look at the `example.py` file and you will see how to use the
`chessclient` module. Per default it currently outputs the board state in
[Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)
but if you want to write a nicer frontend, pull-requests are welcome.

This is just the start... Much more to come :D
